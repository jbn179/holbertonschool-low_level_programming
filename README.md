## üìñ Description
This repository contains C programs and projects developed as part of the Holberton School Low Level Programming curriculum. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of low-level programming concepts, including memory management, data structures, algorithms, and system calls. Each project is designed to build and enhance your programming skills in C.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Basic Syntax and Structure**: Learn the fundamentals of C programming, including syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Memory Allocation and Management**: Understand how to dynamically allocate and manage memory using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.
- **Data Structures**: Implement and manipulate various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- **Algorithms**: Explore common algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.
- **System Calls and File I/O**: Interact with the operating system using system calls and perform file input/output operations.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Develop skills in debugging and testing your code to ensure it is robust and error-free.

### Learning Outcomes:
By working through these projects, you will:
- Gain a solid foundation in C programming.
- Develop problem-solving skills by implementing various algorithms and data structures.
- Learn to write efficient and optimized code.
- Understand how to interact with the operating system at a low level.
- Improve your ability to debug and test your programs.
